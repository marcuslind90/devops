# Jenkins Pipeline with GitHub Pages

Example of how to setup a `Jenkinsfile` for a Jenkins-pipeline that will lint and test 
the application, but also build and deploy the documentation to GitHub pages using the 
`gh-pages` utility.

Note that in a real application, the `docs/` and `app/` directories would be populated,
however in this situation I just initiated them to illustrate the structure of the app.
